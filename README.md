#### _AI enabled citizens grievance system_


#### Overview

This project was made by keeping in mind that it will be a simple & easy to use app, where user will just upload a photo of the grievance & rest of the things will be
taken care by the officials concerned. Users may also anonymously upload their grievances if they want. This system will really help the city be updated & the concerned
officials will be always aware about their surroundings & will be kept in checked through this.

#### Technology used

* Flask : We have used flask for the server where officials will see the tickets or issues posted by their caring and alert citizens.
* Flutter : Flutter has been used to develop a simple easy to use android app and IOS app for the users.
